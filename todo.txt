#1
Before any network scan,
Inform the client about the network scan:
"standard diagnostic procedure to understand the network's state"
Get explicit permission to continue.

#2
connect to the network,
run an Nmap scan.
This will give a complete picture of all the devices and services currently running.
Save the output directly to a file for later analysis and documentation.

nmap 192.168.254.0/24 -oN baseline_scan.txt
nmap -T4 192.168.254.0/24 -oN baseline_scan.txt
creates a file named baseline_scan.txt with all the scan results.

#3
Use the baseline_scan.txt file to identify the devices on the network.
Look for any unknown devices, unexpected open ports, or services that are not running correctly.

#4
identify problems,
apply troubleshooting steps.
This could involve configuring a new port forwarding rule,
updating a device's firmware, or changing a DNS setting.

#5
After changes,
run a second scan to verify fixes

nmap 192.168.254.0/24 -oN final_scan.txt
Compare the baseline_scan.txt to the final_scan.txt.

#6
show the client the "before" and "after" to demonstrate the problem is fixed,
and that the network is now working as expected
prove the value of this work!
